The most discernible differences of a tutorial from a talk are the hands-on nature and the longer duration. By longer duration, generally more content is required and it should remain interesting and keep the attendees awake and hyped even after hours of lecture and exercises. By containing hands-on exercises, the experience of teaching coding to people is necessary. You might also need teaching assistants who you should be able to comfortably communicate during the tutorial, usually at least two teaching assistants for a general class size of 20 people is needed.","Both differences require many times of practice and experience. Therefore, a tutorial speaker usually satisfies at least one of the following prerequisites:"],requirements:["A previous tutorial speaker in any programming conferences or communities","More than one time of speaking experience in open source communities, preferably the local Python communities","Teaching assistant in previous tutorials"],proviso:"We might ask you to give the tutorial to the community before the conference if you lack the experience.",policies:[["Tutorial Duration",["The length of the tutorial is 1 hour and 30 minutes.","In our previous experiences, tutorials with a length of 6 hours are exhausted for both instructors and students, students usually find it difficult to consistently follow in the second half of the tutorial.
