I will highlight the challenges we faced and how we utilized the new features to optimize our data workflows. Whether you are a seasoned Airflow user or new to it, this session will provide you with valuable insights to enhance your data orchestration capabilities.";a.detailed_description="### Why is it a good idea to discuss Apache Airflow 3 at PyCon Taiwan 2025?\r\nApache Airflow is a widely used project with 19 million monthly downloads on PyPI, indicating a significant user base.\r\n\r\nThe release of Airflow 3 happened after the CFP ended, making it a unique topic that not many people are informed about.\r\n\r\n### What makes me qualified to discuss this topic?\r\nI am an Apache Airflow committer, contributing a decent amount of code to Airflow 3, particularly in data-centric syntax and Ruff migration tooling. Additionally, I have been invited to give a similar talk titled \"Airflow 3.0: A First Glance\" [2] in another community.\r\n\r\n[1]: https:\u002F\u002Flists.apache.org\u002Fthread\u002Fc1c6z3n1plb6qvv9r4qb5jqvl89jzkz6\r\n[2]: https:\u002F\u002Fspeakerdeck.com\u002Fleew\u002F20250328-airflow-3-dot-0-the-first-glance\r\n\r\n### Response to Reviewers\r\nThanks reviewers for spending time reviewing!\r\n\r\n#### TO `#DAB0`\r\nSure! I just rewrote the abstract. Please check to see if it's better now.I think \"Application\" would be more suitable than \"Other\" and just updated it. Thanks!\r\n\r\n#### TO `#9197`\r\nI re-read the Python Level [3] description again. \"Intermediate\" is indeed a better choice. Thanks for the suggestion! I've updated it and fixed the typo.\r\n\r\n[3] https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002F2025\u002Fen-us\u002Fspeaking\u002Ftalk\r\n\r\n#### TO `#C6CD`\r\nThis presentation is intended to showcase Airflow 3.0's new features, specifically for an audience with limited technical knowledge. Due to time constraints, I won't be able to discuss the technical details of each topic, as each could easily take up the whole section.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can provide real-world examples as we transition from Airflow 1.10.15 to Airflow 3.0. Many aspects can be handled in a more modern way, which would benefit users who already have some knowledge of Airflow. This can help them understand what improvements can be made by seeing a practical example.\r\n\r\n#### TO `#FB70`\r\nI sincerely apologize, but I'm having difficulty comprehending this comment and, as a result, I am unable to address it adequately. Thank you for your understanding.";a.slide_link="https:\u002F\u002Fspeakerdeck.com\u002Fleew\u002Funlocking-the-future-of-data-pipeline-942ed56f-0083-4e25-9e30-04850095e824";a.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002FrwGhCMX8Yg6shF65gfaRfy";a.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FH1qJ03_Yle";a.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F16\u002F74\u002F16744c180418750eaf2695dae6de9abb.jpg",name:"李唯 (Wei Lee)",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FLee-W",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fclleew",facebook_profile_url:b,bio:"Wei Lee is an open-source ethicist.
