Using pandas, scikit-learn, and visualization libraries, I demonstrate the Python implementation of predictive models that forecast fashion cycles with surprising accuracy. Attendees will learn practical Python techniques for time series analysis, feature engineering for visual data, and building accessible predictive models. The presentation includes Python code walkthroughs that transform complex trend data into actionable insights, with real-world examples of successful predictions and ready-to-use implementations that can be adapted for various cultural analysis projects.",detailed_description:"The talk begins by demonstrating Python implementations that reveal surprising relationships in trend data. I'll walk through the Python code used to collect, clean, and analyze 30 years of fashion data alongside economic metrics, showcasing pandas and numpy techniques that transform seemingly random style shifts into structured patterns.\r\nThe core of the presentation focuses on Python implementation with detailed code walkthroughs for:\r\n\r\nFeature engineering with Python image processing libraries to quantify visual fashion elements\r\nTime series decomposition using statsmodels with practical examples\r\nCorrelation analysis in pandas with visualization best practices\r\nPredictive modeling using scikit-learn with complete code examples for forecasting\r\nValidation techniques and model evaluation with Python testing frameworks\r\n\r\nThroughout the talk, I'll share specific Python functions and classes I've developed that successfully predicted trend shifts, including the revival of Y2K fashion and relationships between economic metrics and design trends. Each case study includes the Python code, data pipeline architecture, and visualization techniques used to communicate findings.\r\nThe presentation includes interactive Jupyter notebooks with matplotlib and plotly visualizations, providing attendees with ready-to-use code templates they can adapt for their own analyses in fashion or other cultural domains.",slide_link:d,slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F3feKThjh37fZXsCEsBFHH1",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FSJrmA3dKgg",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fc3\u002F0c\u002Fc30c183bb7222fbee8fcb3839f7813d9.jpg",name:"Chantal Pino",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fchalory",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fchalory",facebook_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fshare\u002F16EsRuuUDt\u002F?mibextid=wwXIfr",bio:"Chantal Pino is a community leader and software developer from Davao City, Philippines.
