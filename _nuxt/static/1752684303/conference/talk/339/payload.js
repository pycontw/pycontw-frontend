Standard application monitoring falls short. \r\n\r\nFoundational data engineering observability requires a dedicated approach, monitoring system health (logs, metrics, traces), data pipeline jobs and data-centric viewpoints. This talk introduces the essential data pillars – Freshness, Volume, Distribution, Schema, and Lineage – and explores practical Python implementation approaches. We'll demonstrate foundational techniques using libraries like OpenTelemetry, data quality tools (e.g., Great Expectations, dbt test), and custom scripts\u002Fmetrics to establish baseline monitoring. \r\n\r\nBuilding this solid foundation is the critical first step towards enabling the advanced data-driven insights and deep correlation associated with the next version of observability for data pipelines.",detailed_description:"This talk focuses on building the essential foundation for effective Data Engineering Observability. We'll break down the core viewpoints that need monitoring:\r\n1.System Health  \r\n2.Data-pipeline Jobs\r\n3.Data-Centric\r\n\r\nEstablishing baseline monitoring for these core fosus is achievable with proposed Python packages.
