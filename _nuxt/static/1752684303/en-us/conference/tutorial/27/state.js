At its core, however, an Agent is simply a workflow designed to automate tasks using environment tools and enhance its ability to reason, plan, decompose, and execute a given task.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the necessity of planning and reasoning in various industries and build a practical use case. The application will answer user questions based on provided academic notes, and if the information isn’t available, it will search the web. We'll utilize an RAG approach to define and manage a custom knowledge base.\r\n\r\nWith Agentic RAG, the audience will gain clarity on routing concepts, learn how to design an efficient architecture, and understand how the Thought-Action-Observation loop enables an Agent to function effectively. For the tutorial, we will use LlamaIndex for the routing with its ReAcT Agent and Qdrant as the vector database.",detailed_description:"The session bridges theory and practice, demonstrating how to integrate LlamaIndex (for ReAcT Agent routing) and Qdrant (as a vector database) to create an \"Agentic RAG\" system. Key topics include the Thought-Action-Observation loop, and architecture design trade-offs for building routing based LLM application. Ideal for developers and architects, the tutorial emphasizes real-world implementation, from dependency setup to deployment, while clarifying how agents emulate human-like problem-solving.\r\n\r\nAttendees will explore a hands-on use case: building an application that answers user questions using a custom academic knowledge base (via RAG) or web search when necessary.",slide_link:b,slido_embed_link:b,hackmd_embed_link:b,speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fa1\u002Fbb\u002Fa1bb73844bbd23f47a7e161175f4e619.jpg",name:"Tarun Jain",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Flucifertrj",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FTRJ_0751",facebook_profile_url:b,bio:"I am Tarun Jain, currently working as a Super Agent at AI Planet, a Belgium-based AI startup, with over 2 years of experience.
