Illustrate how column‑oriented storage, row‑group statistics, page‑level encodings, and Bloom filters cut data‑scanned by two orders of magnitude. We conclude with a practical comparison of PyArrow, Polars, and DuckDB, demonstrating that modern Python tooling turns these optimizations into one‑liners.";b.detailed_description="With the rise of LLMs and ever-growing datasets in 2025, understanding Parquet’s internals is more valuable than ever for handling data intensive applications and pipelines to have better processing performance.\r\nThis session guides the audience through a structured discovery of Parquet’s architecture. We begin by profiling a multi‑gigabyte CSV to expose its bottlenecks, then introduce each Parquet feature exactly when it eliminates the corresponding pain point: columnar buffers, row groups, pages, statistics, and Bloom filters. Each concept is illustrated with clear visuals or reproducible code snippets to show how it effectively resolves the corresponding challenge.\r\nToward the end of the session, we’ll briefly explore how tools like PyArrow, Polars, and DuckDB leverage Parquet data layout to minimize data scanned and CPU time, demonstrating realistic, practical use cases.\r\nThe talk concludes with practical recommendations—row‑group sizing, partition layouts, codec selection that attendees can apply immediately in their own analytics pipelines.";b.slide_link=a;b.slido_embed_link=a;b.hackmd_embed_link=a;b.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fbc\u002Fb6\u002Fbcb682b786880e31907ab396795fa658.jpg",name:"Josix",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fjosix",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fjosixisoj",facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Hi, I'm Josix.
