Designed for young learners, KangaCode lowers the barrier to entry and turns abstract coding concepts into concrete, interactive experiences. By linking code to immediate visual feedback in a story-driven game, students learn through exploration, experimentation, and play. For example, students learn loops by repeating game actions – not by doing boring exercises.\r\n\r\nI’ll also cover the technical foundation: Pygame for real-time interaction, Django for backend logic and progress tracking, and a sandboxed environment for safe code execution. These systems support learning while ensuring engagement and safety.\r\n\r\nThis talk shares both the educational insights and technical structure behind KangaCode, offering ideas for those exploring the intersection of Python, learning, and play.",detailed_description:"What happens when a young student writes their first line of Python code? Will they see immediate results? Will they stay engaged, or get stuck in syntax errors?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll share the development story of **KangaCode**, a game-based learning platform where students write real Python code to control characters, solve quests, and interact with an RPG-style world. Our goal was to turn coding into something interactive and visual—something that feels like play.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we encountered a number of technical and pedagogical challenges, including:\r\n\r\n- **Helping students connect code to outcomes through meaningful, in-game challenges, providing real-time feedback to maintain motivation**\r\n- **Designing level scripts that align with specific Python concepts and learning objectives**\r\n- **Ensuring student-written code executes safely without compromising system integrity**\r\n- **Tracking student progress and supporting personalized learning pathways over time**\r\n\r\nTo address these, we implemented:\r\n\r\n- **A secure sandbox environment**  \r\n  Using Python’s `ast` module and restricted built-ins, we safely execute untrusted student code while preventing access to sensitive operations.\r\n\r\n- **Concept-driven level scripting**  \r\n  Each level introduces a core Python concept—like variables, conditionals, or loops—mapped directly to gameplay mechanics, guiding students to solve problems through code.\r\n\r\n- **Real-time interaction using Pygame**  \r\n  Pygame delivers immediate visual feedback, helping students connect their syntax to character movement, object interaction, and in-game actions.\r\n\r\n- **Efficient map handling with PyTMX**  \r\n  We use PyTMX to load and manage tile-based maps, enabling smooth performance even on lower-end classroom devices.\r\n\r\n- **Learning progress tracking with Django**  \r\n  Code submissions, level completions, and player actions are logged via Django, allowing for potential future integration of learning analytics and adaptive feedback.\r\n\r\nThis talk will also touch on the educational design principles behind the platform—such as lowering the barrier to entry, reinforcing learning through feedback loops, and encouraging student agency through open-ended exploration.\r\n\r\nIf you're a Python educator, developer, or anyone interested in building engaging, interactive coding tools, this session will offer insights into the design and implementation choices that helped turn abstract programming into a hands-on, playful experience.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Used third-party tools:\r\n\r\n- [Pygame](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pygame.org) – for interactive game development and real-time UI rendering  \r\n- [Django](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.djangoproject.com) – for backend logic, data tracking, and user progress  \r\n- [PyTMX](https:\u002F\u002Fpytmx.readthedocs.io) – for loading and managing tiled maps in the game world\r\n- [AST](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.python.org\u002F3\u002Flibrary\u002Fast.html) - for securely parsing and executing student-submitted code in a sandboxed environment, enabling safe evaluation of Python syntax while restricting unsafe operations.",slide_link:b,slido_embed_link:b,hackmd_embed_link:b,speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fba\u002Fc4\u002Fbac475e209b434497f0e9c1883bf604c.jpg",name:"Chieh-Hung (Jeff) Cheng",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fchengchiehhung",twitter_profile_url:b,facebook_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fshare\u002F1YnznjVFjD\u002F?mibextid=wwXIfr",bio:"I'm the co-founder of KangaCode, an interactive learning platform that helps K–12 students and beginners write their first line of Python through game-based adventures.
