The toolchain for ROS supports Python by default, giving you all of the features, making it really simple to get started with building your own robots!\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a reason to learn Python, and robotics is exciting for you, I am hoping that you can get the introduction from this talk. It is easier to follow if you have a basic understanding of the Python language syntax.",detailed_description:"In the talk, I introduce to the audience that getting started with robotics using Python may be easier than what it may seem at first. I demonstrate a simple approach, using ROS::2 and it's Python API to interact with the system, and build projects, covering an end-to-end approach to developing ROS modules, packaging them into a project, and shipping them to real robots.\r\n\r\nI go through setting up a simple ROS2 project to build a rover with Python, on a Linux computer like a Raspberry Pi and flight controller like Pixhawk using PX4 Autopilot. We begin with defining the scope of the talk: building a basic ROS2 module that can communicate with the controller. Then we go one by one on building the basics: setting up the project, introducing pub-sub model of ROS, showing usage of pub-sub APIs and then using the pub-sub APIs to read from, and write to the controller. The idea is to demonstrate that while it may seem daunting in the start to communicate between hardware and controlling robots, it is in fact very easy given the pre-existing infrastructure.\r\n\r\n**Technologies introduced**\r\n- Python3\r\n- ROS::2 - https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.ros.org\u002Fen\u002Ffoxy\u002Findex.html\r\n- PX4 Autopilot (https:\u002F\u002Fpx4.io)\r\n- DDS and MicroXRCE (https:\u002F\u002Fmicro-xrce-dds.docs.eprosima.com\u002Fen\u002Flatest\u002F)",slide_link:b,slido_embed_link:b,hackmd_embed_link:b,speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F10\u002F21\u002F10213be494fa02f2e409f63483f4191b.jpg",name:"Utkarsh Goel",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Futkarsh867",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fjavachipd",facebook_profile_url:b,bio:"Utkarsh is the co-founder and CTO of Clearbot, a self-driving boat company that cleans trash from the oceans.
