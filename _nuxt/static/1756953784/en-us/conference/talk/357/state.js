From analyzing solar data to powering spacecraft systems, Python is at the heart of various NASA projects, providing flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. This lightning talk will explore how Python is utilized at NASA, highlighting its role in key research projects like the SunPy and Fermipy, as well as its integration into embedded systems like the Core Flight System and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). By showcasing real-world examples, this talk aims to inspire attendees to explore Python's potential in both space missions and embedded systems.",detailed_description:"This lightning talk will explore NASA’s use of Python in space missions like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Core Flight System. We’ll highlight how Python’s simplicity and powerful libraries help NASA process vast amounts of data and simulate complex systems for space exploration.\r\n\r\nThe focus will be on making this topic accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences. We’ll briefly cover key tools like NumPy and Astropy, showing how they aid in analyzing astronomical data and running spacecraft simulations. The goal is not to dive deep into the technical details but to provide an engaging overview of Python’s role in some of the world’s most ambitious space missions.\r\n\r\nAttendees will walk away with a greater understanding of how Python is applied in space exploration, with a focus on its real-world impact, and hopefully be inspired to apply Python in their own fields. This talk will appeal to anyone interested in the intersection of programming and space, whether you're a Python developer, a space enthusiast, or just curious about how technology powers space missions.",slide_link:b,slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F6nBsk759SGWWzwHa4K3jpv",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FHk6WA3OKeg",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F57\u002Fe2\u002F57e293471c09974ef67be9579c36a136.jpg",name:"Sharmaigne Angelie Mabano",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fsharmaigne",twitter_profile_url:b,facebook_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fsharmaigneangelie.mabano\u002F",bio:"Hi! I’m Sharmaigne, a full-stack developer and student tech organizer from the Philippines. I lead SPARCS, a university org that helps students explore tech by building things, running events, and connecting with the local dev scene. I love using Python for creative projects and anything under the sun, from NLP to game dev to competitive programming. I’m especially interested in data, playful tech, and tools that empower people. When I’m not coding, I’m probably organizing something, learning something new, or finding strange ways to mix tech with art, humor, or care."}],event_type:"talk"},relatedData:[],reviewerData:[],configs:{conferenceName:"PyCon TW",conferenceYear:"2025",conferenceDate:"2025-09-06",showAboutStaffPage:a,showConferencePage:a,showSchedulePage:a,showEventOverviewPage:a,showEventsPage:a,showIndexSecondaryBtn:a,showIndexSponsorSection:a,showProposalSystemPage:a,showRegistrationPage:a,showSpeakingPage:d,showSponsorPage:a,showVenuePage:a,aboutHideItems:["apacCommunity"],conferenceHideItems:[],eventsHideItems:[],registrationHideItems:[],venueHideItems:["accommodation"]},i18n:{routeParams:{}}},serverRendered:a,routePath:"\u002Fen-us\u002Fconference\u002Ftalk\u002F357",config:{http:{browserBaseURL:"https:\u002F\u002Fstaging.pycon.tw\u002Fprs"},gtm:{id:"GTM-TNZ39PD"},_app:{basePath:"\u002Fpycontw-frontend\u002F",assetsPath:"\u002Fpycontw-frontend\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:c}}}}(true,"",null,false));
