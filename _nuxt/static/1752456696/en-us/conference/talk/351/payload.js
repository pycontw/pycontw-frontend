At my company, for example, scanned files cannot use our auto-depersonalization pipeline and must be redacted manually, a time-consuming task. This challenge prompted us to seek an open-source OCR solution to be hosted in-house. We identified 3 engines that outperformed others. Using Python’s rapid development capabilities, we built a benchmark to assess each engine’s accuracy, memory usage, and speed with high-fidelity clinical documents. In addition, we used Python bindings to integrate C libraries such as OpenCV, for advanced image preprocessing that greatly enhanced OCR accuracy. This talk will demonstrate the pipeline, share the benchmarking results and highlight the trade-offs of each engine. Attendees will gain practical insights into how Python can be used to evaluate and optimize OSS OCR models in privacy-sensitive environments.";c.detailed_description="OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that converts images of text into actual text that a computer can read and edit.\r\n\r\nCNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to recognize patterns in images and videos. It’s commonly used in tasks like identifying objects in photos, face recognition, and even reading handwritten text.\r\n\r\nRNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to process sequential data.\r\n\r\nSVTR (Scene Text Recognition with a Single Visual Model) directly processes entire images of text using a visual-only model, without requiring sequential modeling like RNNs, to recognize text in natural scenes.";c.slide_link=a;c.slido_embed_link=a;c.hackmd_embed_link=a;c.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F68\u002F07\u002F6807dd1a66bd14970eca3c5d0edccb16.jpg",name:"Bing Wang",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FBingWandEd",twitter_profile_url:a,facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Bing Wang is a Software Engineer at Flatiron, a healthcare technology company focused on building large-scale data platforms for cancer research.
