Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data through effective validation and ETL data pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load) testing is paramount. \r\n\r\nI will introduce the essentials of data validation and ETL data pipeline testing, highlighting processes, types, and best practices. We'll explore frameworks like Great Expectations and dbt to automate and enhance data testing. \r\n\r\nThis talk is designed to equip data engineers and scientists with the knowledge to implement robust data validation strategies, understand the nuances of ETL testing, and maintaining good data quality, and ensuring data pipelines are error-free and efficient.";b.detailed_description="For a focused session within the talk, \"Frameworks Unveiled: Tools for Ensuring Data Quality\". This part of the talk is crucial because choosing the right framework can significantly impact the efficiency and reliability of data validation efforts.\r\n\r\nWrap up by emphasizing the strategic importance of selecting the right data validation framework. Encourage participants to leverage these tools not just for maintaining data quality but also as a means to foster a culture of excellence and innovation within their teams. Invite questions and discussions on framework selection and implementation challenges, fostering a collaborative learning environment.\r\n\r\nFrameworks in this talk:\r\n*  [Great Expectations](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fgreat-expectations\u002Fgreat_expectations) \r\n*  [dbt test](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.getdbt.com\u002Freference\u002Fcommands\u002Ftest)\r\n*  [dbt contracts](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.getdbt.com\u002Fdocs\u002Fcollaborate\u002Fgovern\u002Fmodel-contracts)\r\n*  More frameworks:\r\n    *  [Soda](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fsodadata\u002Fsoda-core)\r\n    *  [Pandera](https:\u002F\u002Fpandera.readthedocs.io\u002Fen\u002Fstable\u002F)\r\n    *  [Fugue](https:\u002F\u002Ffugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io\u002F)";b.slide_link=a;b.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F8B4BwuE4pwcDXzD2PHCG3d";b.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FSJcAP5lT0";b.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F0e\u002Fb7\u002F0eb74e292a2bcb6be9519c8d76faae30.jpg",name:"Shuhsi Lin",github_profile_url:a,twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FShuhsiLin",facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Experienced professional with a proven track record in designing scalable and robust data architectures and fostering a strong engineering culture. \r\n\r\nSkilled in leading high-performance teams to deliver effective data solutions using DataOps principles. \r\n\r\nCurrently focused on enhancing developer experience in  a smart manufacturing and AI department"}];b.event_type="talk";return {data:[{speechData:b}],fetch:{},mutations:[["setSpeechData",b]]}}("",{})));
