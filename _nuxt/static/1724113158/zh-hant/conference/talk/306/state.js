Given a complex dataset, they may feel tempted to use simple summary statistics like the mean, median, or standard deviation to describe it. However, these numbers are not a replacement for visualizing the distribution.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this fact, researchers have generated many datasets that are very different visually, but share the same summary statistics. In this talk, I will discuss [Data Morph](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fstefmolin\u002Fdata-morph), an open source package that builds on previous research using simulated annealing to perturb an arbitrary input dataset into a variety of shapes, while preserving the mean, standard deviation, and correlation to multiple decimal points. I will showcase how it works, discuss the challenges faced during development, and explore the limitations of this approach.",detailed_description:"This talk introduces [Data Morph](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fstefmolin\u002Fdata-morph), a new open source Python package that can be used to morph an input dataset of 2D points into select shapes, while preserving the summary statistics to a given number of decimal points through simulated annealing. Data Morph extends research from Autodesk to create the [Datasaurus Dozen](https:\u002F\u002Fdamassets.autodesk.net\u002Fcontent\u002Fdam\u002Fautodesk\u002Fresearch\u002Fpublications-assets\u002Fpdf\u002Fsame-stats-different-graphs.pdf), and is intended to be used as a teaching tool for illustrating why you can’t rely solely on summary statistics.
