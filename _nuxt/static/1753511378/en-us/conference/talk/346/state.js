We’ll explore how Flet simplifies UI development by abstracting complex Flutter widgets into intuitive Python controls, making it easy for backend and full-stack developers to create cross-platform applications.\r\n\r\n**(Start of Edit)**\r\nTo help the audience better understand where Flet fits in the Python UI ecosystem, the talk will include a concise comparison of Flet with other frameworks like Tkinter, PySide, and Streamlit and compare development speed, resource usage, and intended use cases. This context will help attendees make informed decisions about when to choose Flet for their projects.\r\n**(End of Edit)**\r\n\r\nThrough a live demo, I’ll walk attendees through building and deploying a Flet app from scratch, showcasing key features like:  \r\n\r\n- **State management** for dynamic applications  \r\n- **Real-time updates** for multi-user interactions  \r\n- **Built-in hosting** for seamless deployment  \r\n\r\nBy the end of the session, attendees will gain a solid understanding of how Flet works and how they can integrate it into their projects, making Python-driven UI development faster and more accessible.",slide_link:b,slido_embed_link:b,hackmd_embed_link:b,speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fstatic\u002Fimages\u002Fdefault_head.png",name:"Cyrus Mante",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fmattekudacy",twitter_profile_url:b,facebook_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ffacebook.com\u002Fcyrus.mante\u002F",bio:"He is a versatile professional who embodies the dual roles of educator and developer.
