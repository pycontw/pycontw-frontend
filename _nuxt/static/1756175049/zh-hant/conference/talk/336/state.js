While this approach provides portability and fast startup, it can grow complex over time—especially in organizations with many teams and shared infrastructure—leading to maintainability and scalability challenges.\r\n\r\nThis talk explores how Python-native packaging and environment management can support lightweight, production-ready deployments without sacrificing Docker's benefits. We’ll look at how tools like zipapp (PEP 441) can bundle Python applications, and share strategies for caching Python dependencies within virtual environments to improve startup performance. We'll review examples of how these are integrated into real-world systems. Whether you’re deploying to EMR, Kubernetes, or other infrastructure, you’ll leave with practical patterns—and a clearer mental model for architecting and deploying Python applications at scale.",detailed_description:"This talk is for platform engineers and infrastructure-minded Python developers responsible for deploying Python applications in production environments. It is especially relevant for those facing challenges with startup latency, maintainability, or cost in horizontally scalable systems.\r\n\r\nThis talk focuses on how to separate Python application code, dependencies, and system-level configuration to enable more sustainable and performant deployments. You’ll leave with actionable patterns, practical tooling examples, and a better framework for thinking about Python deployments beyond the default Docker-first approach.\r\n\r\n### Libraries Discussed\r\n* [PEP 441](https:\u002F\u002Fpeps.python.org\u002Fpep-0441\u002F): Using Python’s built-in zip application format (zipapp) to bundle code and dependencies into portable executables.\r\n* [shiv](https:\u002F\u002Fshiv.readthedocs.io\u002Fen\u002Flatest\u002F): A tool that builds self-contained .pyz archives from Python projects.\r\n* [virtualenv](https:\u002F\u002Fvirtualenv.pypa.io\u002Fen\u002Flatest\u002F) and [pyenv virtualenv](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpyenv\u002Fpyenv-virtualenv?tab=readme-ov-file): How understanding Python virtual environments enables caching and reuse in autoscaling environments.",slide_link:b,slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F2sn9LKJMTeDvyXjCAwcjoG",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002Fr1tWChutxl",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F6f\u002Fa6\u002F6fa6a032e32bb0a971e065ed6c14ef25.jpg",name:"Justin Lee",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fleejustin",twitter_profile_url:b,facebook_profile_url:b,bio:"Justin is a software engineer at Notion, where he works on AI and cloud infrastructure.
