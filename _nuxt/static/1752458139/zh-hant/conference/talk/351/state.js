At my company, for example, scanned files cannot use our auto-depersonalization pipeline and must be redacted manually, a time-consuming task. This challenge prompted us to seek an open-source OCR solution to be hosted in-house. We identified 3 engines that outperformed others. Using Python’s rapid development capabilities, we built a benchmark to assess each engine’s accuracy, memory usage, and speed with high-fidelity clinical documents. In addition, we used Python bindings to integrate C libraries such as OpenCV, for advanced image preprocessing that greatly enhanced OCR accuracy. This talk will demonstrate the pipeline, share the benchmarking results and highlight the trade-offs of each engine. Attendees will gain practical insights into how Python can be used to evaluate and optimize OSS OCR models in privacy-sensitive environments.",detailed_description:"OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that converts images of text into actual text that a computer can read and edit.\r\n\r\nCNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to recognize patterns in images and videos.
