Building an AI Agent maybe a popular task among developers, and if you want to build your own AI agent and to learn a few things from do so. This starter's guide is here for you.",detailed_description:"In this workshop, we will first study the relationship between an AI Agent and an AI model. Then, by some hands on exercises, we will learn how to choose the right model, both open source and proprietary, for building your own AI Agent; and how to build an AI Agent from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is designed for participants to be creative and come up with their own unique AI agent ideas. We will only provide the basic knowledge and techniques needed to build an AI agent and guidance for problem solving.\r\n\r\nBy building an AI Agent and comparing  AI models, we will learn more about how AI Agent works and all thing we need to know when considering building an AI Agent for commercial use.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is for those who are confident in coding in Python and have a basic understanding of software development. Knowledge of AI models and AI Agents is not required.",slide_link:b,slido_embed_link:b,hackmd_embed_link:b,speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Faa\u002Fd9\u002Faad9e332fd0fc99e7722a92f336574cf.jpg",name:"Cheuk Ting Ho",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FCheukting",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcheukting_ho",facebook_profile_url:b,bio:"After having a career as a Data Scientist and Developer Advocate, Cheuk dedicated her work to the open-source community.
