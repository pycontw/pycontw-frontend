In this talk, I’ll walk you through how to use Material for MkDocs, a beautiful and powerful static site generator for Python projects, to create professional-quality documentation with ease.\r\n\r\nWe’ll start by introducing the basics of setting up a documentation site using Markdown and Material for MkDocs, then move into automating deployments with GitHub Actions, ensuring your docs stay up-to-date with every push to your repo.\r\n\r\nBeyond styling and deployment, this talk will also explore how to generate content using LLM — turning documentation into a living, evolving part of your project.\r\n\r\nWhether you're maintaining a personal project, an open-source library, or an internal tool, this talk will give you a reproducible, maintainable, and elegant documentation pipeline — all powered by Python.";c.slide_link=a;c.slido_embed_link=a;c.hackmd_embed_link=a;c.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fstatic\u002Fimages\u002Fdefault_head.png",name:"Daniel Gau",github_profile_url:a,twitter_profile_url:a,facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"I am a high school student who programs."}];c.event_type="talk";return {data:[{speechData:c}],fetch:{},mutations:[["setSpeechData",c]]}}("",null,{},false)));
