In this talk, I’ll share how we transformed our data pipeline using PySpark, evolving from traditional JSON access to the Variant format, and ultimately to Spark’s new Variant Shredding feature. By applying these changes in our production environment, where we process large-scale semi-structured event data, we achieved up to 6x faster query performance and improved storage efficiency. I’ll walk through how Parquet’s columnar storage works hand-in-hand with variant shredding to deliver these benefits, and also discuss the trade-offs, such as increased write latency.";b.detailed_description="Key takeaways:\r\n* Understand Variant and Variant Shredding in PySpark.\r\n\r\n* By simply navigating the Spark source code, understand how the variant data structure is shredded.\r\n\r\n* See a real-world case study of how Variant Shredding boosted performance in a production-scale product.\r\n\r\nIf you’re working with semi-structured or nested data using PySpark and looking to optimize analytics at scale, this session will give you practical, real-world strategies you can apply to your own workloads.";b.slide_link=a;b.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F3vQ5KA32Nf2EtjpyxVMrp8";b.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FBJYCT2_Ygg";b.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fstatic\u002Fimages\u002Fdefault_head.png",name:"Wei Jun Cheng",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fwei-juncheng",twitter_profile_url:a,facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"A software engineer at a digital marketing company, handling large amounts of semi-structured data from clients, using technology to help clients create more marketing value."}];b.event_type="talk";return {data:[{speechData:b}],fetch:{},mutations:[["setSpeechData",b]]}}("",{})));
