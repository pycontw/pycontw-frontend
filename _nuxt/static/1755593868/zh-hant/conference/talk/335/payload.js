And now there exists a free-threaded\u002F no-GIL Python 3.13, what difference does it make without the GIL? Let's find out in this talk.";b.detailed_description="In this talk, we will start with explaning concurrency in Python, what's under the hood in multi-threading, and the role of the GIL in Python processes. We will also compare Python to Rust, a programming programming language which allow true multhreading. Then we will discuss what makes free-threaded\u002F no-GIL Python different from the \"regular\" version with the GIL. After that, we will look into benchmarking with different code examples and seeing the different first hand and determine which processes benefit the most from free-threading in Python.";b.slide_link=a;b.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002FarRM45hH2fFrk1YocTsXoB";b.hackmd_embed_link=a;b.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Faa\u002Fd9\u002Faad9e332fd0fc99e7722a92f336574cf.jpg",name:"Cheuk Ting Ho",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FCheukting",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcheukting_ho",facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"After having a career as a Data Scientist and Developer Advocate, Cheuk dedicated her work to the open-source community.
