The research addresses a fundamental gap in geomorphology by enabling quantitative parameter estimation where traditional approaches are limited.\r\n# Innovation\r\nThe most innovative aspect of this work is the integration of physical modeling with machine learning through Python. Rather than treating ML as a black box, this approach builds explainable models that advance geomorphological theory.\r\n# Key Components\r\nFirst, I'll show how Landlab generates synthetic landscapes by simulating uplift and erosion with known parameters. Unlike most ML applications that rely on existing datasets, this approach creates labeled training data from physics-based models.\r\n\r\nSecond, I'll present feature extraction techniques that transform a landscape's elevation grids into meaningful metrics. This includes traditional raster-based geomorphic calculations using NumPy and SciPy, graph-based analysis of the drainage networks using NetworkX.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'll demonstrate how feature importance analysis in Scikit-learn reveals which topographic characteristics are most indicative of the processes parameters. This creates an interpretable bridge between statistical patterns and geomorphological theory.\r\n# Python's Role\r\nThroughout, I'll focus on Python's unique capabilities for interdisciplinary science. The talk will include code examples showing how Python's scientific ecosystem enables this research, but will emphasize domain-specific aspects rather than standard ML techniques.\r\n# Contribution\r\nThis presentation is an opportunity to see Python applied to a specialized scientific domain, adding diversity to PyCon while demonstrating how Python empowers innovative interdisciplinary research.\r\n# References\r\nLandlab documentation: https:\u002F\u002Flandlab.readthedocs.io\u002F",slide_link:c,slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F2mBBZcSmLYxdkoyM8gMwxn",hackmd_embed_link:c,speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F62\u002F74\u002F6274d9fc3ebeed47645e812b92eff1d4.jpg",name:"Ricarido Saturay",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fricsatjr",twitter_profile_url:c,facebook_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fricsaturay\u002F",bio:"I am a Research and Earth Science teacher at the Philippine Science High School.
