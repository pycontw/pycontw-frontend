At my company, for example, scanned files cannot use our auto-depersonalization pipeline and must be redacted manually, a time-consuming task. This challenge prompted us to seek an open-source OCR solution to be hosted in-house. We identified 3 engines that outperformed others. Using Python’s rapid development capabilities, we built a benchmark to assess each engine’s accuracy, memory usage, and speed with high-fidelity clinical documents. In addition, we used Python bindings to integrate C libraries such as OpenCV, for advanced image preprocessing that greatly enhanced OCR accuracy. This talk will demonstrate the pipeline, share the benchmarking results and highlight the trade-offs of each engine. Attendees will gain practical insights into how Python can be used to evaluate and optimize OSS OCR models in privacy-sensitive environments.";b.detailed_description="- Understand why commercial OCR tools can't be used in certain fields and what this means for automation.\r\n- Discover 3 top-performing OSS OCR engines, how they compare, and where each one excels or falls short.\r\n- Learn to build a Python-based benchmarking pipeline that assesses OCR engines on speed, and accuracy using real clinical data formats.\r\n- Gain practical insights into how to use Python to wrap C libraries and advance image preprocessing to improve OCR outcomes.";b.slide_link=a;b.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002FhN7HWrRL23A3UpX8PnJhjF";b.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002Frkxsf02OFee";b.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F68\u002F07\u002F6807dd1a66bd14970eca3c5d0edccb16.jpg",name:"Bing Wang",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FBingWandEd",twitter_profile_url:a,facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Bing Wang is a Software Engineer at Flatiron, a healthcare technology company focused on building large-scale data platforms for cancer research.
