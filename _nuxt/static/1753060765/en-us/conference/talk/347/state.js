I'll then explain how we moved to standard forms of unsupervised machine learning with rotation and reflection invariance so that we could expand our search to a larger and more diverse database of (Physics STM) images. I will cover in detail how, using Python, we implemented patch searching, image hashing using discrete cosine transforms, then finally geometrical hashing based on positions of atoms and clusters.\r\n\r\nTHOMPSON, D. W. 1961. On Growth and Form. Cambridge.",detailed_description:"Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) images contain a wealth of data on the arrangements and patterns of atoms on surfaces. This is useful for both basic science and for building new, high-technology two dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures for next-generation electronics and nanomaterials. One project we are working on is the detection of long-range order in superficially \"chaotic\" atomic arrangements with strong Fourier transform components (2D quasicrystal) and higher order coincident (HOC) arrangements. \r\n\r\nTo this end we have developed various techniques, from kernel (image patch) correlation to autocorrelation that work on these notoriously noisy images with stubborn artifacts. But we wanted to go further, searching a larger library of images for more patterns, and remove the human element for scientific objectivity. So we decided to apply unsupervised machine learning. To keep the data size manageable, images need to be broken down to smaller elements and these often need to be further \"hashed\" into a handful of numbers, representing either discrete cosine transform coefficients, or small spatial relationships of predefined features, which in our case are individual atoms and the \"holes\" - centers of the 5, 6, and 7 atom rings of atoms.\r\n\r\nWhile our application was specific, there is no difference between seeking repeated instances of the \"bumblebee\" and \"butterfly\" shaped atomic clusters in our data, and seeking instances of cats, dogs, or human faces in real world media. Thus the python implementation and package usage I'll discuss is just as relevant to the general ML community as it is to surface scientists.",slide_link:b,slido_embed_link:b,hackmd_embed_link:b,speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F28\u002F1d\u002F281da5e8ee4e0d4747763e13ded43adc.jpg",name:"David Mikolas",github_profile_url:b,twitter_profile_url:b,facebook_profile_url:b,bio:"BS.
